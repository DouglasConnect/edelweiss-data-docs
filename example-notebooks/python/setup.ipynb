Authentication is done with the authenticate call. Be aware that this call is currently built for interactive use like in a Jupyter environment - it will block execution for a up to a few minutes while it waits for you to log in to your account and confirm the access to the API on your behalf. Once accepted the python client will store the authentication token so that you will not have to enter it again for a few days (the token is stored in your home directory in the .edelweiss directory)."
